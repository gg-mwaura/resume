        <h3><em>Founder and CEO of <st>NURU</st></em></h3>
        <p>I am a researcher and writer, focusing mainly on geoscience topics, and environmental and energy security.
          Based in Germany, I spend much of my time on research expeditions.
          This page was created as a service to my in marketing effectiveness research team, and other consultants working on projects concerning energy.
          The research study is not intended to be indicative of any products or services related to energy from geoscience, but is rather designed to
          help improve energy marketing decisions through a scientific look into the decision process, and by providing potentially useful insights and methods.</p>
